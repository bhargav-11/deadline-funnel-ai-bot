Question: Why are my subscribers being redirected away even though they have X days left in their deadline?


Answer: There are several reasons why this could be happening. In 99% of cases, our team discovers it’s related to something in the setup of Deadline Funnel that can be resolved. But the specific solution depends on knowing more about your situation.


Our team will need to know the following:


1. The name of your Deadline Funnel campaign
2. Email address of 1 or ideally 2 people reporting this issue


Thx.
