Question: Why am I being redirected away from my deadline page?


Answer: If you’re being redirected away from your offer page, it means your own deadline has expired.


Please try clearing your own tracking from your Deadline Funnel campaign.


You can do this by going to Edit campaign > Testing > Clear tracking. Please note that in some cases you may also need to clear your browser’s cookies/cache. Sometimes it helps to test in a different browser, too, after you clear your tracking in Deadline Funnel. :slightly_smiling_face:

We also have a Preview Mode feature that you can enable in your account:

You can add your IP address to Preview Mode so that you do not get redirected from any of your pages even after your deadline expires.
